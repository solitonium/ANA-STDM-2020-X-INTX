\subsubsection{Weights applied to MC events}
\label{sec:Weights_applied_to_MC_events}

The weight applied to each MC event is computed as the product of the following factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_mc} - weight produced by the MC generators;
    \item {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_pileup} - weight intended to make the pileup distribution in MC to be consistent with that in data;
    \item {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_leptonSF} - lepton scale factor;
    \item {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_bTagSF\_MV2c10\_70} - scale factor correcting the $b$-tagging efficiency;
    \item {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_jvt} - scale factor correcting the distribution of the {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont JVT} variable;
\end{itemize}

Our preselection of events includes the requirement of one lepton or two leptons that are both satisfy trigger conditions.
So we are using the default {\fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont weight\_leptonSF} that is computed for single lepton according to Eq. \ref{eq:weight_leptonSF_singl}:

% \begin{equation}
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:weight_leptonSF_singl}
    % { \fontfamily{txtt}\selectfont
    weight\_leptonSF = weight\_leptonSF\_Reco\ *\ weight\_leptonSF\_Trigger\ \\
    *\ weight\_leptonSF\_ID\ *\ weight\_leptonSF\_Isol\ *\ weight\_leptonSF\_TTVA
    % }
\end{multline}
% \end{equation}

All individual weights used in (Eq. \ref{eq:weight_leptonSF_singl}) are provided by the Muon Combined Performance Group.
