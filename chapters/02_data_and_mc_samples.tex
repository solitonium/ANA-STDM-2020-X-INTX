The analysis is performed on the low pile-up data samples of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV collected by ATLAS in 2017 and 2018 years.

Event selection is the same as used for low pile-up analysis paper~\cite{Kretzschmar:2657141}.

The full list is given in Appendix~\ref{sec:details_on_list_of_MC_samples}.
