\AtlasAbstract{%
  Interesting hints of lepton non-universality have been seen in decays of B hadrons.  
  Measurements from LEP on W decays also show a hint of non universality at the level of a few percent. 
  The ATLAS experiment has produced over $10^9$ W decays to leptons, which allows us to make a high-precision measurement of lepton (non)-universality in W decay by measuring the ratio $R_{\tau/\mu} =  BR (W\rightarrow \tau\nu \rightarrow \mu\nu\bar{\nu}) / BR (W \rightarrow \mu\nu)$, in which many systematic effects are cancel. 
  Main challenges are control of the non-W background and trigger related systematics.
  Our results \todo{agree/disagree} with the value of $R_{\tau/\mu} = 1$ expected in the case of Lepton Flavour Universality as predicted by the Standard Model.
